### Dependencies

AskOmics need the Virtuoso triplestore to work.

[Compile virtuoso](https://github.com/openlink/virtuoso-opensource/blob/develop/7/README)

or install via docker

```bash
docker pull askomics/virtuoso

docker run --name my-virtuoso \                                                                                                                              
    -p 8890:8890 -p 1111:1111 \
    -e SPARQL_UPDATE=true \ 
    -v /tmp/virtuoso_data:/data \         
    -d askomics/virtuoso

replace `/tmp/virtuoso` with a directory of your choice.

Your virtuoso is available at [localhost:8890](localhost:8890).

### Manual installation
